# Hello.AI.World

Some simple repository to get started with .NET Semantic Kernel APIs and some AI models for application. It just for some fun and learnings, not a rocket science.

Mainly it is a very simple console application that you can have

- [x] Make some chat with given AI model
     - Asking some questions and getting some relevant answers
- [x] Suggesting some local custom data within Memory
- [ ] Text chunck
- [ ] Vector store and search from there
- [ ] Plugins

It can be run locally with Ollama for some LLM. There is also "devcontainer.json" file to have required images.

There is also new GitHub Marketplace for models(Preview) - https://github.com/marketplace/models It is currently in preview but check to try-out.

I will try to update this repository to learn and play more. And please feel free to share any feedback or help me out to figure out those, I will really appreciate...
