# Hello.AI.World

Some simple repository to get started with .NET Semantic Kernel APIs and some AI models for application. It just for some fun and learnings, not a rocket science.

Mainly it is a very simple console application that you can have
- Make some chat with given AI model
  - Asking some questions and getting some relevant answers
- Suggesting some local custom data within Memory

It can be run locally with Ollama for some LLM. There is also "devcontainer.json" file to have required images.

There is also new GitHub Marketplace for models(Preview) - https://github.com/marketplace/models It is currently in preview but check to try-out.

I will try to update this repository to learn and play more.
